## Remote Signing setup via TMKMS for Umee "canon-2" chain testnet.

**Please notice.**

In security proposes we test TMKMS at Umee testnet, but there is no difference between seting from mainnet. Just edit chain-id and obviously use mainnet private key. 

At remote signing host (where we setup tmkms) should be managed high level of security. Like non root access, firewalls etc.. 

Best option to use VPN tunel for connection between remote signer host and validator node.
